Welcome to our Mushroom Dashboard! This simple dashboard serves to run various predictive models on the mushroom and car_evaluation datasets.
You will find the dataset, two python scripts, and two folders in the main folder alongside this readme document.
The python scripts serve as part of the basic infrastructure of the dashboard.
One folder named 'images' stores the images used in the infrastructure of the dashboard.
The other folder named 'Analysis_Tabs' stores 5 python scripts which are used by the dashboard to run 5 different types of predictive models.
We hope you enjoy playing around with it!
